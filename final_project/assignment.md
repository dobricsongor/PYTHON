# Final project


Based on a topic of your choosing, create a problem definition that properly describes the requirements of an application from the chosen topic. You can use as an example the problem definition given for the midterm project. Make sure the requirements are specific enough and the described problem is not too wide.

The problem definition must take into consideration the use of the followings in the implementation:
> * a minimum of two custom collections (mandatory a sequence and a mutable mapping),
> 
> * each class must implement custom __str__ and __repr__ methods,
>
> * a minimum of one of the following: decorator, context manager, and generator,
>
> * mixin, inheritance, and one scenario of operator overloading,
>
> * logging (using the standard logging), and
>
> unit testing.

For each component that we build, we have to add use cases and some tests to showcase the functionality and test that it meets all the requirements.

In a new file, separated from the showcasing code, you will add tests for the implementation.

The project will consist of three files:
> * requirements.txt - will store all the requirements of our problem definition,
>
> * application.py - the implementation,
>
> * playground.py - a file showcasing the functionality and proving it implements fully the requirements, and
>
> * tests.py - the unittests.

Components share in grading:
> * problem description and requirements: 20%
>
> * implementation: 40%
>
> * showcasing the implemantation: 30%
>
> * tests: 10%
